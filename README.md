🚀 Task 3 Completed! 💻✨

I’m excited to share that I have successfully completed Task 3: Designing the Login Page using NetBeans IDE (Design Window) as part of the Full Stack, Web Development & Java Developer Internship.

📌 In this task, I:

Created a new Java project and designed the UI using Swing components.

Implemented a clean and intuitive layout with labels, text fields, password fields, and buttons.

Used NetBeans IDE’s Design Window to align and style components professionally.

Centered the form and ensured responsive layout behavior.

🛠️ Tools Used: Java, NetBeans IDE

📽️ Attached below is a short demo video showcasing the interface.

Grateful for this opportunity to polish my Java GUI development skills. Looking forward to building more!
